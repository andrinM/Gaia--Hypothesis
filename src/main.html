    <h1>My Argdown Argument Map</h1>
    <argdown-map>
    [Geophysiological Gaia]: the biosphere can be modeled as a single giant organism
    - [Teology]
    - [not falsifiable]
    +> [Optimizing Gaia]: life optimizes the physical and chemical environment to best meet the biospheres needs //alternative wording: the biota alter the physical and chemical enironment to their own benefit
        - [Natural selection 1]: NS favors organisms that can best exploit their environment, so organisms are often dependent on the services their ecosystem provides.
            Thus they benefit from their environment even though it has not been constructed to conform to their needs. //p.399
        -[Natural selection 2]: NS will favor both environment-enhancing and environment-degradiing traits, as long as those
            traits confer a reprodutive advantage over the non carrires
        + [Planetary scale feedback system] //p. 400
        +> [Homeostatic Gaia]: atmosphere-biosphere interactions are dominated by negative feedback
            - [no evidence of only negative feedback] //alternative arguments:
            //- [ice core records]
            //- [Collection of negative feedbacks]
            //- [Phytoplankton has a positive feedback]
            +> [Coevolutionary Gaia]: evolution of life and the evolution of its environment are intertwined, with each affecting the other
                + [Generally excepted]
                +> [Influential Gaia]: life collectively has a significant effect on Earths environment
                    + [Generally excepted]
