Gaian: in the Gaia literature, mechanisms linking organisms to their environment are generally termed ‘Gaian’ only if they create negative feedbacks, and only if they are beneficial to
the organisms involved, or to the biota as a whole.

Non-Gaian: Positive feedbacks, or those that seem detrimental, are typically referred to as ‘nonGaian’ or ‘anti-Gaian’ mechanisms.
