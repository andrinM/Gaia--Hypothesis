[Gaia and Homeostasi]: atmosphere-biosphere interactions are dominated by negative feedback,
and that this feedback helps to stabilize the global environment

[Gaia and Environmental Enhancement]: Gaia claims that the biota alter the physical and chemical environment
to their own benefit //s. 398

[Gaia and Natural Selection]: Earth is self-regulated, in a state that is favorable for life,
by biologically mediated feedbacks

[Main Thesis]: organisms stabilize the global environment and make it more suitable for life

# 3 Gaian feedbacks can evolve by natural selection, but so can anti-Gaian feedbacks

<Differential Advantage Argument>

(1) Trait X increases an organism's ability to survive and reproduce.
(2) Organisms carrying trait X have more offspring than those without it.
(3) Trait X becomes increasingly common within the population.
----
(4) Therefore, trait X provides a differential advantage, meaning natural selection favors trait X.

<General Advantage Argument>

(1) Trait Y provides advantage Z to its carriers.
(2) The same advantage Z provided by trait Y is available to non-carriers.
(4) Since both carriers and non-carriers of Y benefit equally from
advantage Z, Y does not confer a differential advantage.
----
(5) Therefore, natural selection has no effect on Y, and Y is considered a general advantage.

<Environmental Enhancing Trait Argument>

(1) Carriers of trait Z enhance the environment.
(2) The environment enhanced by carriers of Z is shared among all members of that species.
----
(3) Non-carriers of Z benefit equally from the enhancements made by carriers.
----
(4) Because both carriers and non-carriers of Z benefit equally, the presence
of Z does not provide a advantage to carriers alone.
----
(5) [Environmentally enhancing traits are not a sufficient
condition for a reproductive advantage]


/**
Thus claims that "life enhancing effects would be favored by natural selection" are
not generally valid.

A(x): x has a enviromental enhancing trait
B(x): x has a reproductive advantage (over who?)

¬(A -> B)
∃x: (A(x) ∧ ¬B(x))
*/

/**
It is still theoretically possible for evolution to systematically favor Gaian traits over
anti-Gaian ones, but only if environments and their organisms are jointly subject to some
form of natural selection, in competition with other environment/organism assemblages.
This would create a kind of metapopulation, and natural selection in metapopulations can
produce evolutionary outcomes that would otherwise seem counterintuitive    
However, a mechanism needs to be demonstrated by which such natural selection could occur in this
context.

----
(4) NS does not generally apply to Environmentally enhancing traits
----
(5) Natural selection is the only mechanism who drives life
(6) natural selection does not happen intentionally

(7) env enhancing traits are not intentionally given
----
(8) the biota does not alter the environment intentionally

<Natural Selection Argument for Argument 2 v2>

(1) Natural Selection is the only mechanism to get traits
(2) Natural selection does not happen intentionally
-----
(3) All traits are inherited unintentionally
----
(4) Environment enhancing traits are inherited unintentionally
(5) Environment enhancing traits are necessary for biota to alter environment (for their own benefit)
----
(6) Biota does not intentionally alters environment for their own benefit
// because the trait was not given intentionally
